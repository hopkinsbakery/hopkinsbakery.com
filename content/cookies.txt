	<dt>ANZAC (Australian New Zealand Army Corps)</dt>
	<dd>-- An old time favorite started in World War I named for the brave soldiers in their honor. The origin of the cookie comes from the fact that the simple ingredients (honey, rolled oats, flour, coconut, butter) do not spoil easily so the cookies kept well during naval transportation to loved ones who were fighting abroad. A very healthy and yet yummy cookie to try!</dd>
